# PHP-SoftwareEngineer_Project
Restaurants Management System project for my Software Engineer Course.
It is still in very early development, I have included the User Case Diagram for easier understanding.
The project may not work with you as it uses myphpadmin, and the database being used is stored on my account, so to make it work for you, you might need to open phpmyadmin on your computer using XAMPP or anything and make a database with the same name and same columns as the ones stated in the code.

The Project will consist of 3 Sides: 
1) Adminstrator Side: only admins will access this part, will be able to add/delete/edit other admins and workers, add/delete/edit menu items, and view recent receipts.
2) Customer Side: will be able to create an account, then be able to view the menu with the items added from the admin, and order or cancel food.
3) Worker Side: will be able to order food for clients, and print the receipts for them.
