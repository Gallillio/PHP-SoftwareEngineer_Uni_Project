# PHP-SoftwareEngineer_Project
Restaurants Management System project for my Software Engineer Course.
It is still in very early development, I have included the User Case Diagram for easier understanding.

The Project will consist of 3 Sides: 
1) Adminstrator Side: only admins will access this part, will be able to add/delete/edit other admins and workers, add/delete/edit menu items, and view recent receipts.
2) Customer Side: will be able to create an account, then be able to view the menu with the items added from the admin, and order or cancel food.
3) Worker Side: will be able to order food for clients, and print the receipts for them.
